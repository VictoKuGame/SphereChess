##### Description :

Created a small chess game for 2 players on one machine, implemented only the classic chess movements as a main core loop witout adding the spheric addon abbilities and restrictions. The game is builded from several parts, each one controlls a specific aspect of the game , from the initial distribution of the game pieces, to the all possibile movements that are rellevant for a specific chess piece and to a overall controller which observe whats happening on the board and controlls the abstract level of the game.
